        The April Uprising of 1876 broke out prematurely on April 20 in the old style in Koprivshtitsa and was <br>
        organized by the Giurgiu Revolutionary Committee. Although unsuccessful, it is a kind of peak of the <br>
        Bulgarian national liberation movement. Today's estimates are that the uprising, although unsuccessful, <br>
        has achieved another major goal, the political one, as the popular uprising for independence resonates <br>
        strongly in Western Europe and Russia. The uprising was prepared at a distance of only 1-2 months, <br>
        which explains the failures in the organization and its course. The decision to revolt was taken by<br>
        individual BRCC activists. It is not supported by any external force and is ultimately the result of the <br>
        efforts of several apostles. More serious preparations for the revolt were made only in the IV and I <br>
        districts. The uprising was suppressed by brutal massacres, torture and looting. This is causing outrage in <br>
        Europe and America. An international commission of inquiry has been convened in Constantinople.<br>
        Great personalities such as Victor Hugo and Dostoevsky raised their voices in defense of the Bulgarians. <br>
        The April Uprising of 1876 deepened the Eastern Crisis, and its success was in its international resonance, <br>
        achieved with the heroism of thousands of victims. Soon after the uprising, the Russian-Turkish Liberation War broke out.
