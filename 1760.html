        The writing of Slavyanobulgarskaya History by Paisii Hilendarski is considered to be the peculiar beginning <br>
        of the Bulgarian Revival. The history was written in the period 1760-1762. Its first transcript is the work <br>
        of Sophrony of Vratsa (1765). The work of the monk Paisius of Mount Athos is rightly pointed out as an <br>
        important impetus for the formation of the Bulgarian national self-consciousness. In the long years of <br>
        slavery, Bulgarians lost their sense of community, the homeland for most of them has shrunk to their own <br>
        small town or village. The Bulgarians had a great history and great kings, but they did not know about <br>
        their past. Structurally, the History consists of several parts - 2 prefaces, several chapters, which set <br>
        out various historical events, a chapter on Slavic teachers, a chapter on Bulgarian saints and anafterword.
