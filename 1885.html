        The unification of Bulgaria was the de facto unification of the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia in the autumn of 1885. It was coordinated by the <br>
        Bulgarian Secret Central Revolutionary Committee (BTCRC). The unification took place after riots in various cities in Eastern Rumelia, followed by a <br>
        military coup on September 6 (September 18 in a new style) 1885, supported by the Bulgarian Prince Alexander I and led by Major Danail Nikolaev. <br>
        On the night of September 6, troops commanded by Major Nikolaev established control over Plovdiv and, without resistance, overthrew the government and <br>
        Governor-General Gavril Krastevich. The Provisional Government, which includes representatives of the army of both southern Bulgarian parties, led by <br>
        Georgi Stranski, announced a general mobilization of men aged 18 to 40 to resist the expected Turkish attack and invited Prince Alexander Battenberg to <br>
        support the Union.The events in Plovdiv provoked mass demonstrations in support of the Principality. Faced with a fait accompli, Karavelov set out to establish <br>
        the Union in cooperation with the prince. On September 8, Alexander I issued a proclamation declaring himself "Prince of Northern and Southern Bulgaria", <br>
        and the next day he was in Plovdiv and appointed three commissioners to replace the interim government, which relinquished its powers. Meanwhile, <br>
        the princely government mobilized its army and sent its available troops in support of the militia in southern Bulgaria.
