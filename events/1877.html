        There is hardly a Bulgarian who does not feel proud at the mention of the date March 3. The liberation of <br>
        Bulgaria was the actual restoration of Bulgarian statehood after five hundred years of Ottoman rule, as a <br>
        result of the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878). The foundations of Bulgarian independence were laid with the <br>
        San Stefano Peace Treaty. On April 12/24 (new style) 1877, a manifesto of Emperor Alexander II was issued in <br>
        Chisinau, declaring war on Russia by the Ottoman Empire. In addition to the Balkans, the fighting is taking <br>
        place in the Caucasus. By deceiving the enemy, the Russian army created a feeling in the Ottoman High Command <br>
        that the main Russian forces would be landed in Dobrudja. On June 15 (June 27), Russian units, commanded by <br>
        Major General Mikhail Dragomirov, landed on the Danube River near Zimnich-Svishtov <br>
        The main strategic plan of the Ottoman command was for Suleiman Pasha's group to break the cover units <br>
        fortified on the slopes of Shipka Peak and to cross into northern Bulgaria to join the besieged Ottoman <br>
        troops in Pleven under the command of Osman Pasha. It was then planned to repel Russian troops north of the <br>
        Danube through concerted action from the east, west and south. At this critical moment, the Russian high <br>
        command realized that it did not have a serious strategic reserve to repel the counterattack. The heroic <br>
        battles that took place under Shipka Peak decided the outcome of the war. The entire Bulgarian militia is also within the Front Detachment. <br>
        The victory of the defenders was a turning point, followed by a final victory for Russia in the rest of Bulgaria.The war ended with the signing of the <br>
        San Stefano Peace Treaty and the establishment of an independent Bulgarian principality. The restoration of Bulgaria was confirmed by the Treaty of Berlin, <br>
        and legally until 1908 the Principality of Bulgaria was a tribunal, although in practice it was independent of the High Gate. <br>
        The newly created Principality of Bulgaria is self-governing, but dependent on the Ottoman Empire. It is tributary (paying taxes) <br>
        with its own people's government and army. Eastern Rumelia was an area within the Empire that enjoyed administrative autonomy, <br>
        including its own armed forces ("local militia").
