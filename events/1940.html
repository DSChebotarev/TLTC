        Include this episode of native history as a kind of bonus to the rankings made so far. <br>
        With this act, which is the work of the joint efforts of the entire Bulgarian people, <br>
        together with the church and a number of political figures and intellectuals who raise their voices in <br>
        defense of Bulgarian Jews. The events in Bulgaria in the period 1940-1944, connected with the fate of <br>
        the Jews, are observed today mostly as a successful attempt to save them from deportation to the Nazi <br>
        death camps. But that's not all. The strong reaction against the anti-Jewish law, the attacks on the <br>
        very philosophy of persecution of people on ethnic and religious grounds, the disagreement with the <br>
        unconstitutional restriction of the rights of any citizen say that these events have a much wider <br>
        scope than salvation itself, namely that they are directed against anti-Semitism in general.
