        The baptism of Bulgaria is a process of acceptance and establishment of Christianity as the official state <br>
        religion in Bulgaria, which began in 864. The adoption of Christianity has a crucial historical significance <br>
         for Bulgaria, because it is associated with the establishment of the Bulgarian Church, the spread of the <br>
         Slavic script and the evolution of the state from khanate to kingdom. Since the establishment of the <br>
         Bulgarian state in 681, it has been inhabited by two main ethnic groups - Slavs and Proto-Bulgarians, <br>
        as well as Byzantines and other tribes with different religious traditions. However, they cannot merge <br>
        into one nation, as there are significant differences between them - linguistic, ethnic, cultural, religious, <br>
         everyday. Such a merger would only be possible if there was a single religion that imposed common norms and <br>
         values. In addition, there are well-known Roman Christians living in the country. Their number is constantly <br>
         increasing with the conquest of new territories by Byzantium. This diverse ethno-religious mass creates <br>
         problems in society.At the beginning of 864 a spiritual mission headed by a bishop came to Bulgaria, which <br>
         dealt with the baptism of the people. For security reasons, Khan Boris I was secretly baptized at night, <br>
         accepting the spiritual name of Emperor Michael III. Boris-Mikhail also accepted the Slavic title of <br>
         "Grand Duke". Some of the Bulgarian boyars opposed and preserved paganism, but this provoked decisive <br>
         actions on the part of Prince Boris to establish Christianity and unite Slavs and proto-Bulgarians in one <br>
         Christian nation. Through the adoption of Christianity, Bulgaria affirms its place as a <br>
         sovereign state in the European world.
