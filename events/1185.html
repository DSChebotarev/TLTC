        The uprising broke out on October 26, 1185 - the feast of St. Dimitar Solunski, caused by the increase in <br>
        taxes, and ends with the creation of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom, ruled by the Asenevtsi dynasty. At the <br>
        head of the uprising are the two brothers Assen and Peter, who are dissatisfied with the emperor's refusal <br>
        to give them the requested pronia on Trapezitsa and the current Tsarevets. Under their leadership, the <br>
        uprising in 1186 failed, but after their retreat across the Danube, the following year the uprising became <br>
        organized and the victories were not long in coming. In a short time they liberated the main settlements of <br>
        Northern Bulgaria (excluding Preslav) and managed to penetrate the Stara Planina passes in Thrace. <br>
        The eldest of the two Assenevtsi, Peter (1187-1197), was proclaimed king.<br>
        In the summer of 1186, the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelus decided to deal with the rebels and marched against <br>
        them with a large army. Unable to oppose him, Assen and Peter were forced to withdraw their troops north of the <br>
        Danube. After the return of the emperor to Constantinople, Assen and Peter again crossed into the Bulgarian lands <br>
        he was forced to make a truce with them, which officially recognized the restoration of the Bulgarian state north <br>
        of the Balkan Mountains. He already heads the state as Tsar Ivan Asen I.
