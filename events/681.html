        Of course, we start with the very existence of our country as a state. We focus on the creation of <br> 
        Danube Bulgaria, because this is the peculiar beginning of our statehood in these lands. The establishment <br>
        of the Bulgarian state on the Balkan Peninsula is one of the most remarkable political events in Europe in <br>
        the 7th century, after the Great Migration. In 680, Emperor Constantine IV Pogonat (Bradati) (668-685) <br>
        launched a campaign against the Bulgarians by land and sea. The huge Byzantine army gathered in Ongala and <br>
        along the Danube. The battle ended with a grand victory of the proto-Bulgarians, after which they crossed <br>
        the Danube and conquered the lands to the Balkan Mountains, subjugated the local Slavic tribes and <br>
        concluded an alliance agreement with their princes for joint action and defense of the conquered territory. <br>
        As a result of this agreement, in the autumn of 680, Khan Asparuh built a military-political alliance with <br>
        the Moesian Slavs, directed against Byzantium, Avar and Khazaria, and with this act the new Bulgarian state <br>
        was actually created. Priority and dominance in the country have the proto-Bulgarians with experience of <br>
        Great Kubrat Bulgaria and their strong cavalry, which continues to attack the Byzantine territories in <br>
        Thrace. In the summer of 681 - around August 9 - the emperor was forced to conclude a peace treaty with <br>
        Khan Asparuh. According to this treaty, the emperor recognized the conquered lands and undertook to pay an <br>
        annual tax. Thus Byzantium legally recognized the existence of the new Bulgarian state in the Balkans and <br>
        Bulgaria gained legitimacy in interstate relations.
