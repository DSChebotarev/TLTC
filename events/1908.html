        The independence of Bulgaria was proclaimed with a manifesto on September 22, 1908 in the church <br>
        "St. Forty Martyrs ‚Äùin Tarnovo. The independent Bulgarian kingdom was recognized by the Great Powers <br>
        in the spring of 1909. Prince Ferdinand I accepted the title of King of the Bulgarians. A commemorative <br>
        medal is established on this occasion. The next day, Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina.<br>
        Bulgaria responded to the threats of war by the Ottoman Empire with military mobilization and at the <br>
        same time declared its readiness for a peaceful settlement. As the Berlin Treaty has been doubly violated <br> 
        (by Sofia and Vienna), and the Great Powers are not ready for a large-scale war, efforts are focused on <br>
        diplomatic recognition of Bulgarian independence. An interesting point is the recognition of this title. <br>
        The word "king" comes from Caesar and Caesar. As long as Russia claims to be the "Third Rome", no other <br>
        Orthodox country dares to introduce this title. In 1910, in preparation for the Balkan wars, <br>
        Tsar Ferdinand was in St. Petersburg, where they organized a solemn "royal" ceremony to welcome him. <br>
        Preconditions have been created for the liberation of the last remaining Bulgarian lands in Ottoman rule <br>
        in Thrace and Macedonia.
