        The emergence of the Old Bulgarian alphabet and the Slavic script is related to the work of the two first <br>
        teachers Cyril and Methodius and their students, as well as the policy of Byzantium and Bulgaria to influence <br>
        the Balkan and Middle Danube Slavs.The two brothers have the highest Byzantine education, they know the Slavic <br>
        language well, as they were born in Thessaloniki to a Slavic mother (Methodius was born in 815, and his younger <br>
        brother Constantine in 826). They are close to the imperial court - Methodius held the high position of archon, <br>
        and Constantine the Philosopher participated in two state missions - the Saracens in 855 and the Khazars in 860.<br>
        From 855 to 862 the two brothers worked in the monastery "St. Polychron ‚Äùin Asia Minor, composed the first <br>
        Slavic alphabet - Glagolitic and began translating the liturgical books together with their Slavic students. When <br>
        in 863 the Great Moravian Prince Rostislav asked the Byzantine emperor to send him teachers to preach in the <br>
        Slavic language, the two brothers Constantine the Philosopher and Methodius left on a new mission to Great <br>
        Moravia, where in the period from 863 to 869 together with his students carry out active educational activities <br>
        among the Danube Slavs and train hundreds of priests and teachers.At the church debate in Venice, Constantine <br>
        the Philosopher successfully defended the right of the Slavs to have their own written liturgical language on a <br>
        par with Greek and Latin. Cyril and Methodius were solemnly received by Pope Adrian II in Rome, the Pope <br>
        consecrated the Slavic books and a liturgy in the Slavic language was celebrated.
